# AICodeRally Franchise System

**Last Updated:** November 28, 2025

> **Master Reference:** See [`UNIFIED_ARCHITECTURE.md` Section 8](https://github.com/AICodeRally/aicoderally-stack/blob/master/UNIFIED_ARCHITECTURE.md#8-franchise-layer) for the authoritative specification.

AICodeRally is a **product + franchise** model designed to scale AI-native app development across multiple locations and skill levels.

---

## The 3-6-∞ Framework

AICodeRally organizes the entire platform into **three distinct tiers** that define how ideas become apps, how apps become businesses, and how businesses scale into enterprise systems.

### Framework Overview

**Studio** = **3 Steps** (Ideate → Create → Validate)
**Edge** = **6 P's** (People, Process, Product, Performance, Pipeline, Platform)
**Summit** = **∞** (The 6 P's + Governance, Scale, Integration, Intelligence, Strategy, Change)

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐

    │    Ideate → Create → Validate         │

```

This simple, powerful framework scales from individual creators to global enterprises.

## The Three Tiers Explained

### 🎨 Studio – The App Layer (3 Steps)

**Goal:** Transform a single idea into a working, validated application.

**The 3-Step Loop:**

1. **Ideate** - Clarify the problem, audience, use case, and value
2. **Create** - Generate the app: UI/UX, flows, interactions, lightweight data
3. **Validate** - Test with users, gather feedback, refine, iterate

**Outputs:**
- Scoping artifacts
- Business case mini-apps
- Working prototype apps

**Philosophy:** Studio produces **atomic, focused apps**, not business systems.

---

### 🟧 Edge – The Business Layer (The 6 P's)

**Goal:** Turn one or more Studio apps into a functional business operating system.

**The 6 Universal Pillars:**

#### P1 — People
Roles, permissions, stakeholders, collaborators

#### P2 — Processes
Operational workflows, task flows, delivery cycles

#### P3 — Products / Programs / Offers
What the organization delivers: services, programs, packages

#### P4 — Performance
KPIs, dashboards, impact metrics, sales/engagement analytics

#### P5 — Pipeline
Lead management, client/customer lifecycle, donor/partner flows

#### P6 — Platform
Tools, automations, integrations, communication and billing systems

**Outputs:**
- Verticalized "Edge Solutions" (npEdge, bhgEdge, Designer Biz Kit, Brand Hub)
- Business workflows (projects, grants, programs)
- Dashboards, analytics, templates
- Operational portal rooted in the 6 P's

**Philosophy:** Edge produces a **Business OS**.

---

### 🟪 Summit – The Enterprise Layer (∞ Expansion)

**Goal:** Unify multiple Edge portals, systems, teams, and data into a governed, scalable enterprise solution.

**Summit extends the 6 P's with enterprise-grade capabilities:**

#### + Governance
Policies, approval flows, compliance, risk management

#### + Scale
Multi-team, multi-unit, multi-region execution

#### + Integration
Data meshes, system orchestration, enterprise architecture

#### + Intelligence
AI agents, automation governance, predictive insights

#### + Strategy
Enterprise performance, OKRs, transformation roadmaps

#### + Change Management
Rollout, training, adoption, cross-org alignment

**Outputs:**
- Summit Solutions (e.g., Summit SPM Governance)
- Executive dashboards
- Cross-business workflows
- Enterprise data models
- AI-enabled orchestration

**Philosophy:** Summit delivers **system-of-systems transformation**.
